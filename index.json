To translate these benefits into hardware, a growing number of neuromorphic spiking NN processors have attempted to emulate biological NNs. These developments have created an imminent need for methods and tools that enable such systems to solve real-world signal processing problems. Like conventional NNs, SNNs can be trained on real, domain-specific data; however, their training requires the overcoming of a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical nature. This article elucidates step-by-step the problems typically encountered when training SNNs and guides the reader through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the spiking setting. Accordingly, it gives an overview of existing approaches and provides an introduction to surrogate gradient (SG) methods, specifically, as a particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned challenges.\n","date":1584145319,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584145319,"objectID":"012ec52007321be399b45ddd54f377ed","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/post/neftci_etal19_spm/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T17:21:59-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/neftci_etal19_spm/","section":"post","summary":"Bringing the power of gradient-based optimization to spiking neural networks","tags":[],"title":"New Article: Signal Processing Magazine on Surrogate Gradient Learning","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584057600,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Courses Taught","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["M Payvand","M.

However, neuromorphic implementations of embedded learning at large scales that are both flexible and efficient have been hindered by a lack of a suitable algorithmic framework. As a result, most neuromorphic hardware are trained off-line on large clusters of dedicated processors or GPUs and transferred emphpost hoc to the device. We address this by introducing the neural and synaptic array transceiver (NSAT), a neuromorphic computational framework facilitating flexible and efficient embedded learning by matching algorithmic requirements and neural and synaptic dynamics. NSAT supports event-driven supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms including deep learning. We demonstrate the NSAT in a wide range of tasks, including the simulation of Mihalas--Niebur neuron, dynamic neural fields, event-driven random back-propagation for event-based deep learning, event-based contrastive divergence for unsupervised learning, and voltage-based learning rules for sequence learning. We anticipate that this contribution will establish the foundation for a new generation of devices enabling adaptive mobile systems, wearable devices, and robots with data-driven autonomy.","tags":null,"title":"Neural and Synaptic Array Transceiver: A Brain-Inspired Computing Framework for Embedded Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EO Neftci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"58c07e5a23a49a04cb8853eb6a2011d1","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-17/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.985817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-17/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic synapses as resource for efficient deep learning machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EO Neftci","C Augustine","S Paul","Georgios Detorakis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"b6f91f2677ca7a629144fd498df6f18b","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-etal-17-a/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.984013Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-etal-17-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Event-Driven Random Back-Propagation: Enabling Neuromorphic Deep Learning Machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EO Neftci","C Augustine","S Paul","Georgios Detorakis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"c4be9b3fb62f7e33cead43c9336d75c1","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-etal-17/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.983665Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-etal-17/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Event-driven Random Back-Propagation: Enabling Neuromorphic Deep Learning Machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G Detorakis","TD Bartley","EO Neftci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"17e4a7734d16204e55d70ccce3699cd1","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/detorakis-etal-17/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.9728Z","relpermalink":"/publication/detorakis-etal-17/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contrastive hebbian learning with random feedback weights","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.
