To translate these benefits into hardware, a growing number of neuromorphic spiking NN processors have attempted to emulate biological NNs. These developments have created an imminent need for methods and tools that enable such systems to solve real-world signal processing problems. Like conventional NNs, SNNs can be trained on real, domain-specific data; however, their training requires the overcoming of a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical nature. This article elucidates step-by-step the problems typically encountered when training SNNs and guides the reader through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the spiking setting. Accordingly, it gives an overview of existing approaches and provides an introduction to surrogate gradient (SG) methods, specifically, as a particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned challenges.\n","date":1584145319,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584145319,"objectID":"012ec52007321be399b45ddd54f377ed","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/post/neftci_etal19_spm/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T17:21:59-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/neftci_etal19_spm/","section":"post","summary":"Bringing the power of gradient-based optimization to spiking neural networks","tags":[],"title":"New Article: Signal Processing Magazine on Surrogate Gradient Learning","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584057600,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Courses Taught","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["M Payvand","M.

Neuromorphic hardware that emulate the biological processes of the brain on a physical, electronic substrate are emerging as ultra low-power alternatives for performing such tasks where adaptability and autonomy are critical. However, neuromorphic hardware lacks general and efficient inference and learning models of the type that empower artificial neural networks, while being compatible with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. This research will bridge isolated fields of machine learning and neuromorphic engineering, and address the energetic and performance merits of computing under physical constraints on communication, precision, retention and failures. The solutions sought to meet these challenges will outline the principles for designing continuously learning hardware, resistant to soft errors and failures of future and emerging computing and memory technologies.This interdisciplinary effort will bring a multifaceted skill set to students and researchers alike, and impact many domains of embedded computing, such as brain implants for detecting and alleviating neurological conditions, implantable prosthetics, assistive robots capable of learning and performing human-level cognitive tasks, as well as defense and surveillance related workloads. To encourage young generations to this approach, the PI will 1) organize hands-on workshops, 2) initiate a student-driven project for developing educational tools targeted for teaching K-12 students the building blocks of spike-based deep learning, and 3) offer public video and lab-based courses on neuromorphic intelligence, including hands-on experiments with cutting edge neuromorphic hardware for students.\nThe proposed approach will study the stochastic nature of biological neurons and synapses to provide a blueprint for inference and learning machines compatible with the digital and mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. The goals of this vertically-integrated project will be achieved by devising: 1) Spike-based algorithms guided by statistical machine learning theory that operate on information that is locally available to the underlying physical and neural processes that achieve or surpass the performance of equivalent learning algorithms in deep artificial neural networks; 2) Dedicated scalable neuromorphic hardware architectures for ultra low-power, continuously learning, which are key to adaptive behavior in embedded real-time behaving systems; 3) Rules governing the organization of attention and working memory in the brain using insights obtained from neural networks models equipped with dynamic feedback loops. In tandem with the breakthroughs in deep recurrent neural networks, this project aims to create unprecedented transfer of knowledge, sparking the foundations for novel computers that proactively interpret and learn from real-world data, solve novel problems using what they learned, and operate with the efficiency and proficiency of the human brain.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"2877094b4770a6567a05ea11a0788e51","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/project/career16/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/career16/","section":"project","summary":"Learning in Neuromorphic Hardwar","tags":["Spiking Neural Networks","Learning","Synaptic Plasticity"],"title":"Scalable Neuromorphic Learning Machines","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553644800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553644800,"objectID":"fff46b2f666ec9ae69b34043ae03b48c","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/cogsci110sq19/","publishdate":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cogsci110sq19/","section":"courses","summary":"Spring 2019","tags":null,"title":"COGS110: Quantitative Methods for Cognitive Scientists","type":"courses"},{"authors":["E.

However, neuromorphic implementations of embedded learning at large scales that are both flexible and efficient have been hindered by a lack of a suitable algorithmic framework. As a result, most neuromorphic hardware are trained off-line on large clusters of dedicated processors or GPUs and transferred emphpost hoc to the device. We address this by introducing the neural and synaptic array transceiver (NSAT), a neuromorphic computational framework facilitating flexible and efficient embedded learning by matching algorithmic requirements and neural and synaptic dynamics. NSAT supports event-driven supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms including deep learning. We demonstrate the NSAT in a wide range of tasks, including the simulation of Mihalas--Niebur neuron, dynamic neural fields, event-driven random back-propagation for event-based deep learning, event-based contrastive divergence for unsupervised learning, and voltage-based learning rules for sequence learning. We anticipate that this contribution will establish the foundation for a new generation of devices enabling adaptive mobile systems, wearable devices, and robots with data-driven autonomy.","tags":null,"title":"Neural and Synaptic Array Transceiver: A Brain-Inspired Computing Framework for Embedded Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EO Neftci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"58c07e5a23a49a04cb8853eb6a2011d1","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-17/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.985817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-17/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic synapses as resource for efficient deep learning machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"685c9c03c9ff41986925c6d1f1654881","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/psych269fq17/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/psych269fq17/","section":"courses","summary":"Fall 2017","tags":null,"title":"PSYCH 269: Brain-Inspired Learning Machines","type":"courses"},{"authors":["EO Neftci","C Augustine","S Paul","Georgios Detorakis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"b6f91f2677ca7a629144fd498df6f18b","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-etal-17-a/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.984013Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-etal-17-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Event-Driven Random Back-Propagation: Enabling Neuromorphic Deep Learning Machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EO Neftci","C Augustine","S Paul","Georgios Detorakis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"c4be9b3fb62f7e33cead43c9336d75c1","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-etal-17/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.983665Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-etal-17/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Event-driven Random Back-Propagation: Enabling Neuromorphic Deep Learning Machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490572800,"objectID":"3b8581574981f655c873697a5c9a055b","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/cogsci110sq17/","publishdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cogsci110sq17/","section":"courses","summary":"Spring 2017","tags":null,"title":"COGS110: Quantitative Methods for Cognitive Sciences","type":"courses"},{"authors":["G Detorakis","TD Bartley","EO Neftci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"17e4a7734d16204e55d70ccce3699cd1","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/detorakis-etal-17/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.9728Z","relpermalink":"/publication/detorakis-etal-17/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contrastive hebbian learning with random feedback weights","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"7e5023d7422372d81cca099ce1ef094e","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/psych269sq17/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/psych269sq17/","section":"courses","summary":"Spring 2017","tags":null,"title":"PSYCH 269: Neuromorphic Engineering","type":"courses"},{"authors":["S.

A relatively smaller body of work, however, addresses the similarities between learning dynamics employed in deep artificial neural networks and synaptic plasticity in spiking neural networks. The challenge preventing this is largely caused by the discrepancy between the dynamical properties of synaptic plasticity and the requirements for gradient backpropagation. Learning algorithms that approximate gradient backpropagation using local error functions can overcome this challenge. Here, we introduce Deep Continuous Local Learning (DECOLLE), a spiking neural network equipped with local error functions for online learning with no memory overhead for computing gradients. DECOLLE is capable of learning deep spatio-temporal representations from spikes relying solely on local information, making it compatible with neurobiology and neuromorphic hardware. Synaptic plasticity rules are derived systematically from user-defined cost functions and neural dynamics by leveraging existing autodifferentiation methods of machine learning frameworks. We benchmark our approach on the event-based neuromorphic dataset N-MNIST and DvsGesture, on which DECOLLE performs comparably to the state-of-the-art. DECOLLE networks provide continuously learning machines that are relevant to biology and supportive of event-based, low-power computer vision architectures matching the accuracies of conventional computers on tasks where temporal precision and speed are essential.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"6df16cbe23cd0fb3e4a0151113209063","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/project/sgtheory/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sgtheory/","section":"project","summary":"Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with the Tools of Deep Learning","tags":["Spiking Neural Networks"],"title":"Deep Continuous Local Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"One ongoing challenge in brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computing is to devise general and computationally efficient models of inference and learning which are compatible with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain.

Recent studies have shown that synaptic unreliability is a robust and sufficient mechanism for inducing the stochasticity observed in cortex. We introduced the Synaptic Sampling Machine (SSM), a stochastic neural network model that uses synaptic unreliability as a means to stochasticity for sampling.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"5154fb110f69645819befd7db672adb2","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/project/ssm/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ssm/","section":"project","summary":"Learning with Stochastic Synapses and Neurons","tags":["Spiking Neural Networks"],"title":"Stochastic Spiking Neural Networks","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1459036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459036800,"objectID":"b3274d5268066e04f122fd3988018799","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/psych269wq19/","publishdate":"2016-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/psych269wq19/","section":"courses","summary":"Spring 2016","tags":null,"title":"PSYCH 269: Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning","type":"courses"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1459036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459036800,"objectID":"2ad3bc1b2020b4fbdd11fdb5898902c3","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/psych269wq18/","publishdate":"2016-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/psych269wq18/","section":"courses","summary":"Winter 2018","tags":null,"title":"PSYCH 269: Neuromorphic Engineering","type":"courses"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1459036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459036800,"objectID":"d943419a276ee60e7d1984d68e1c6d98","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/psych169sq16/","publishdate":"2016-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/psych169sq16/","section":"courses","summary":"This course focuses on brain-inspired models to create artificial minds.","tags":null,"title":"PSYCH169: Neural Processing in Artificial Minds","type":"courses"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1459036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459036800,"objectID":"2ae57154ea42822b52054013fb04c466","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/courses/psych205csq16/","publishdate":"2016-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/psych205csq16/","section":"courses","summary":"Spring 2016","tags":null,"title":"PSYCH205C: Computational Statistics","type":"courses"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning in a wide variety of cognitively relevant tasks prompts the question whether the ingredients of their success are compatible with neurobiology and neuromorphic hardware. Recent work in three-factor synaptic plasticity rules suggests that synaptic plasticity dynamics are compatible with gradient-based learning, provided that credit can be assigned to hidden neurons. Our preliminary work shows that local errors computed from layer-wise loss functions can approximate credit in deep layers and enable spiking neurons to learn complex tasks, outperforming existing spike-based BPTT methods in learning speed and accuracy, while relying on spatial complexity linear in the number of neurons. The resulting learning rule is local and largely compatible with the Loihi architecture. Our team will showcase variations of this strategy in the Intel Loihi hardware and demonstrate them on suitable computer vision and reinforcement learning benchmarks using the Dynamic Vision Sensor.\n","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"334a0967f7a65e85bb2a50d3241053e4","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/project/loihi19/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/loihi19/","section":"project","summary":"Learning on the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip","tags":["Spiking Neural Networks","Learning","Synaptic Plasticity"],"title":"Loihi Embedded Plasticity Dynamics for Deep Continuous Local Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["Emre Neftci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"01389e11e923cbcf59b01236a86ad62f","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-16/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.985523Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-16/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic neuromorphic learning machines for weakly labeled data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EO Neftci","Bruno Umbria Pedroni","Siddharth Joshi","Maruan Al-Shedivat","Gert Cauwenberghs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"abf512c7f3187e8e684874b0572abef6","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/neftci-etal-16/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.983349Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neftci-etal-16/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic Synapses Enable Efficient Brain-Inspired Learning Machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Fonollosa","E Neftci","M Rabinovich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1446336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446336000,"objectID":"79fa65fce6522316897247e1c22c8644","permalink":"https://eneftci.github.io/publication/fonollosa-etal-15-a/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T23:43:42.976217Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fonollosa-etal-15-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning of Chunking Sequences in Cognition and Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.
